# Features:

- Entity component systems
- Multiple render passes
- Deferred rendering
- Materials
- Multiple mesh materials/sub-mesh
- FBX material importing (wip) 
- FBX model loading with Assimp
- Multiple point lights + shadows
- Post process pass
- Imgui UI

# Components

- Transform component (Entity position/scale)
- Render component (Entity material/mesh)
- Player component (controllable entity)
- AABB component (Entity bounding box)
- Point light compnent (Point light data)

# In progress:
